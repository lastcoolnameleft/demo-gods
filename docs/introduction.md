# Introduction

## About this book

First off, thanks for your time and interest in this book.  

## Why did I write this book?

This idea spawned after my second reading of Neil Gaiman's American Gods.  American Gods is a fairy tale which assumes that gods only exist and gain strength due to our belief in them.  Without human's belief in them, they whither away.

Anyone who has presented or watched a live demo at a technical conference has heard of "The Demo Gods".  These are gods who will tamper with your demo if you don't appease them through sacrifice.  This got me wondering:  Given this is a polytheistic belief, who are they?  What type of sacrifices do they desire?

This book is an exploration into this pantheon and how we can better prepare ourselves for their interference.

## Who is this book for?

If you've made it this far, then probably you.

Objectively, this book is for anyone who wants to become better at giving demos and what to prepare for.

## Overview

This book will explore the different types of demo failures one can expect (or not expect as is usually the case), how they manifest themselves, who is responsible and where to focus your attention to prevent future issue.
